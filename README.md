# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Final Project: "Football"

## Theme

How you thought about or interpreted the theme:
- I pretty immediately thought of the classic "Nuclear Football" trope, and the idea of being a small character defending a literal "Big Red Button" on a briefcase computer. Of course, I'll always relish the opportunity to name my game something like "Football."

## Gameplay

Objective:
You are a literally and figuratively small man, standing alone against the hands of nuclear annihilation. Defend the Football!

Gameplay instructions:
Use your trusty handgun to stop the hands from reaching the Big Red Button. If even one finger touches the button, the world explodes.

## What did you 
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game:

- It took me entirely too long to figure out how to make the enemies spawn in random locations across a defined area while also all facing the correct direction. I have a hard time wrapping my head around the physics of rotations et cetera.

- Transform data seemed inconsistent between the "Button" object and other positions, but I found out after a quick search that this was just because the pivot was not set to Center.
